 similar phenomenon occurred in the United Kingdom, with young, comparatively affluent workers in the media and digital industries moving into traditionally working class areas of London such as Hoxton, Spitalfields, and, particularly, Shoreditch with the subsequent gentrification of these areas. The subculture was parodied in the magazine Shoreditch Twat (1999) and the television sitcom Nathan Barley[15] (2005). The series, about a self-described "self-facilitating media node,"[16] led to the term Nathan Barleys being used pejoratively in London for the subculture it parodied.[17]
